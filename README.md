# 180-days-of-webdev

Inspired by the book "So good, They can't ignore you", this is my attempt to put in Deliberate pratice on my career capital. Since failing #100-days-of-code, I Don't want to make this appear like a challenge, and will not treat it like one.

As per this project, I am to build craftmanship over MERN stack. I will have logged, on what I have studied and understood, this time with a feedback, a blog post every productive day.

Same as #100-days-of-code, Iâ€™ve decided to make this a public commitment.

**Goal - To become Good at the craft of building websites, mobile and web applications**
